# YuKman's Pong 🎮

A classic Pong game built from scratch using C++ and SFML 3, featuring a menu system, basic game settings, credits, and two-player local gameplay.

This project is my very first SFML game, created after only three weeks of learning SFML.  
At college, I am currently studying only the fundamentals of C++, so this game represents my first step into graphics, game loops, and interactive programming.

PS: The game does not include any sound yet, as I haven’t learned how to implement audio in SFML. This will be added in my future small projects as I continue learning.

## 🚀 How to Build

### Requirements
- Visual Studio 2022/2026 with Desktop development with C++
- SFML 3.0.2 for Visual C++

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YumanKh/YuKman-s-pong.git
```

2. Download [SFML 3.0.2](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php) for Visual C++ 64-bit

3. In Visual Studio, open Project Properties:
   - VC++ Directories → Include Directories: add `path/to/SFML/include`
   - VC++ Directories → Library Directories: add `path/to/SFML/lib`
   - Linker → Input → Additional Dependencies: add:
     ```
     sfml-graphics-d.lib
     sfml-window-d.lib
     sfml-system-d.lib
     ```

4. Copy all `.dll` files from `SFML/bin/` into your project output directory

5. Copy the following asset files into the same directory as your `.exe`:
   - `BlackGameFont.ttf`
   - `MenuWallpaper2.jpg`
   - `MenuSprite.png`
   - `MenuQuitSprite.png`

6. Build with Ctrl+Shift+B and run with Ctrl+F5
